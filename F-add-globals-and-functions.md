# F-add-globals-and-functions

Now comes the finish work.

You may have constant and global variables to declare, we're finishing off so put them in!

Build out the remainder of your detail functions and run tests.

## Compile and test frequently

Don't write too many lines of code without checking and compiling.  Even when it compiles and runs, you want to scrutinize the output and the results.
