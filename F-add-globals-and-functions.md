# F-add-globals-and-functions

Now comes the finish work.

You may have constant and global variables to declare, we're finishing off so put them in!

Build out the remainder of your detail functions and run tests.

## Make sure each function has a `return`!

Many of your functions will not work in your program if they don't return a value.  However, others may not be as touchy.

However, *I will be checking each function for `return`*.  Don't miss it.

## Compile and test frequently

Don't write too many lines of code without checking and compiling.  Even when it compiles and runs, you want to scrutinize the output and the results.

## Set up separate 'test' functions to test your functions

Sometimes, just running from `main` won't give you the testing you need.  You should feel free to set up test functions and tweak `main` so that it only tests one or another function until you're satisfied the "real" function works.

## Create a pull request to branch "F-add-globals-and-functions" for feedback
**OPTIONAL**
You do not have to do this, but it could be a useful milestone for you, and allows me the opportunity to give you feedback when I can.

## Additional milestones

I have added more branches G and following.  These are not required any more than the other interim branches.  However, you may want to use them, so go ahead.
