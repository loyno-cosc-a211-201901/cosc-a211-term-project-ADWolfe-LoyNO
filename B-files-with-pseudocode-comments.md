# B-files-with-pseudocode-comments

You will continue to use the same .cpp file (or files) that you began with before.

You are developing incrementally as you go.  You will be able to trace all of your development step-by-step, commit-by-commit in Git/GitHub.

## Write in "pseudocode" programming logic in comments

Now you will go into the actual logic for your program.  Write the steps needed in comments.  Put these comments into your `main ()` function.  Here's how we might write "pseudocode" for a game inspired by "Angry Birds"...

	int main () {
		// Angry Profs main program
		// Get the player's name
		// Set game counter to zero
		// REPEAT
		//     generate a distance to the Dean
		//     tell player distance
		//     ask player the launch angle
		//     launch prof and assess hit
		//     add to score if needed
		//     add one to game counter
		// REPEAT UNTIL GAME COUNTER PASSES 5
		// tell player final score
	}

## Compile the file
Yes, the file *still* doesn't do anything, but that is actually still OK.

## Create a pull request to branch "B-files-with-pseudocode-comments" for feedback
