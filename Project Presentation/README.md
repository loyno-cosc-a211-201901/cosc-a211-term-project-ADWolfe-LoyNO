Each student is required to make a presentation to the other students as part of the project.  This will take place in the last week of class and may be presented online, or recorded if necessary.

Note that this is a *separate* milestone rather than the final submission of the project.  You may add or refine your project after the presentation if you have time.  By the same token, you *do not need to have the final project finished* to make your presentation.

## Four to Six Minutes

You are not doing a huge presentation here!  Scale it as a brief exposition of what you've done.

## Introduction
Give a one- to two-minute introduction of what your project is and what your goals were

## Demonstration

Most of you are doing programming projects.  You should be ready to demonstrate what you have working at that time.  Practice your demonstrations before giving them in class!!!!

## Slides

Those of you writing papers should have a PowerPoint file ready with 8-14 slides to go through your project.

## Learnings
Each student should finish his presentation by taking a minute or two to report what he learned or the conclusions drawn in the project. 

## Supporting Files go into "Project Presentation" folder

Any files you use for the presentation, whether slides or documents or data files, should be put into this subfolder as part of your submission.
