# A-initial-files-with-description

The first step I suggest is for you to create an empty C++ file.

Please begin the file name with your last name, but you can name it whatever you like after that.

Don't include spaces in the file name.  It will cause you a big pain in the neck.

Now, add in your `#include` and `using namespace` etc and create an empty `main` function.

In comments, write a description of what you want your program to do. 

## What should I describe? How?

Just write a narrative including the following sorts of things:

* what you want your program to do
* The sequence of actions your user will take
* What you expect the results to be
* What you want the program user to see
* What calculations or logic do you want the program to do
* Are you reading or using files?
* Are you writing information to files?

## Compile the file
Yes, the file doesn't do anything, but that is actually still OK.
