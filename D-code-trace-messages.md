# D-code-trace-messages

Now we will prepare our file with "pre-emptive debugging."  Stay in your same file and keep building it.

Write messages for the steps of your pseudocode.  If the pseudocode comment says

	// Launch the prof at the dean

then add a message

	cout << "Launching prof at the dean" << endl;

## Compile the file and Run
Now, you run your program and it tells you what it will be doing, that is, what it will be doing when you have finished programming it.  Compile and run and you should see a sequence of messages that tell you what (will be) is happening.  This should match the descriptions of your project and give you some ability to assess how you are doing.
